How do we multiply two vectors together? There is more than one way!

#  The scalar or Dot Product (the result is a scalar).
#  The vector or Cross Product (the result is a vector).


                                                                       Dot Product


We can calculate the Dot Product of two vectors this way:

Where:
|a| is the magnitude (length) of vector a
|b| is the magnitude (length) of vector b
θ is the angle between a and b

So we multiply the length of a times the length of b, then multiply by the cosine of the angle between a and b

OR we can calculate it this way:

a · b = ax × bx + ay × by

So we multiply the x's, multiply the y's, then add.


                                                                       EXAMPLE

  a = (-6,8)  
  b = (5,12) 
  θ = 59.5 degree

Calculate the dot product of vectors a and b:

        a · b = |a| × |b| × cos(θ)
        a · b = 10 × 13 × cos(59.5°)
        a · b = 10 × 13 × 0.5075...
        a · b = 65.98... = 66 (rounded)

OR we can calculate it this way:

      a · b = ax × bx + ay × by
          
          a · b = -6 × 5 + 8 × 12
          a · b = -30 + 96
          a · b = 66

                                                                     CROSS PRODUCT

We can calculate the Cross Product this way:

                  a × b = |a| |b| sin(θ) n


a| is the magnitude (length) of vector a
|b| is the magnitude (length) of vector b
θ is the angle between a and b
n is the unit vector at right angles to both a and b


OR we can calculate it this way:

When a and b start at the origin point (0,0,0), the Cross Product will end at:

  cx = aybz − azby
  cy = azbx − axbz
  cz = axby − aybx


              Example: The cross product of a = (2,3,4) and b = (5,6,7)

                         cx = aybz − azby = 3×7 − 4×6 = −3
                         cy = azbx − axbz = 4×5 − 2×7 = 6
                         cz = axby − aybx = 2×6 − 3×5 = −3

                                Answer: a × b = (−3,6,−3)
