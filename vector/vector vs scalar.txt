                                             Vector vs Scalar

A scalar has magnitude (size) only.

Scalar: just a number (like 7 or âˆ’0.32) ... definitely not a vector.

A vector has magnitude and direction, and is often written in bold, so we know it is not a scalar:

*so c is a vector, it has magnitude and direction
*but c is just a value, like 3 or 12.4

Example: kb is actually the scalar k times the vector b.
