                                             Magnitude of a Vector

The magnitude of a vector is shown by two vertical bars on either side of the vector: |a|

We use Pythagoras' theorem to calculate it:

|a| = √( x2 + y2 )

Example: what is the magnitude of the vector b = (6, 8) ?

|b| = √( 62 + 82) = √( 36+64) = √100 = 10

A vector with magnitude 1 is called a Unit Vector.
