                         linear independent vector

if we can not construct a vector by adding two given vectors,
then this vector is lineary independent.

EXAMPLE:  THESE vectors linearly independent.

a = (1,2,-1), b = (3,-4,5), c = (1,-8,7)

because c is not equal to a+b 
or b is not equal to a+c
or a is not equal to c+b 

NOW, a= (1,1) and b = (2,2)
they are not lineary independent because b = 2a. we can form b by stretching a two times longer.
