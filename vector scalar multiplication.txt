                                          Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar

When we multiply a vector by a scalar it is called "scaling" a vector, because we change how big or small the vector is.

Example: multiply the vector m = (7, 3) by the scalar 3

a = 3m = (3×7, 3×3) = (21, 9)

It still points in the same direction, but is 3 times longer

And now you know why numbers are called "scalars", because they "scale" the vector up or down.(negative scalar number)
